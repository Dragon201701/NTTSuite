<WRN>[CEG-SCVER]  SystemC 2.2 compatibility is currently selected but the built-in installation (i.e. '/opt/mentorgraphics/Catapult_10.5c/Mgc_home/pkgs/cds_cpc/rls/tools/systemc2.2/') does not point to such SystemC installation.
<WRN>[CEG-BSCI]   The SystemC installation in built-in SystemC (i.e. '/opt/mentorgraphics/Catapult_10.5c/Mgc_home/pkgs/cds_cpc/rls/tools/systemc2.2/') cannot be used and will be ignored.

<WRN>[TDB-DRF]    Some flops have been removed by dead/unmapped logic pruning. Please refer to '/home/jd4691/research/NTT_CPU/peaseNTT_nocpy/Catapult_2_1/peaseNTT.v4/./CDesignChecker/calypto/mapping.log' for the list of removed flops.
<WRN>[ORC-WIPCC]  Consistency checks have identified at least one non-fatal design violation in the spec design. Please refer to the file 'CDesignChecker/calypto/ccheck_spec.log' for details.
